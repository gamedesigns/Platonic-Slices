A mobile puzzle game named Platonic, where main principle would be rotating sliced 3d object , to give it its original form. This could be very satisfying, as some objects could have even perpendicular or diagonal slices . The puzzles must be solvable, at first player would see geometric bject, then it would get sliced and jumbled, then he would turn and rotate a segment to position, where ut would click to place. When the model would be finished, next platonic object would be the next level. Cube, pyramid, hexahedron etc. Lower levels could have lower number of slices.

Here are some design considerations that could enhance the experience:

**Progression Structure:**
- Start with 2-slice cuts (cube split in half), then 4 slices, 8 slices, etc.
- Begin with simple parallel cuts before introducing perpendicular and angled slices
- Each Platonic solid could have multiple levels with increasing complexity

**Visual Feedback Systems:**
- Subtle magnetic attraction when pieces are nearly aligned
- Color-coded edges that must match up
- Ghost outlines showing the target shape
- Particle effects or satisfying sound when pieces snap into place

**Slice Variety:**
- Parallel slices (easier)
- Perpendicular intersecting cuts (medium)
- Diagonal/angled cuts (harder)
- Curved cuts for advanced levels
- Mixed cut types in later puzzles

**Control Mechanics:**
- Tap to select a piece, then drag to rotate
- Two-finger gestures for more complex rotations
- Snap-to-grid rotation for accessibility
- Undo function for experimentation

**Progression Path:**
1. Cube (most familiar)
2. Tetrahedron (4 faces, simpler)
3. Octahedron (8 faces)
4. Dodecahedron (12 faces)
5. Icosahedron (20 faces, most complex)

Perpendicular slices could create really interesting interlocking puzzles where pieces must be assembled in a specific order.
