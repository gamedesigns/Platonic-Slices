# In work to implement (needs finish):

**🎮 Complete Options Modal:**

**⚙️ Settings Available:**
1. **Platonic Solids**: Cube, Tetrahedron, Octahedron, Dodecahedron
2. **Primary Slices**: 2-8 slices (adjustable slider)
3. **Perpendicular Cuts**: 0-3 cuts (perpendicular to primary slicing plane)
4. **Diagonal Cuts**: 0-2 cuts (45° diagonal cuts)
5. **Difficulty**: Easy/Normal/Hard (45°/30°/15° snapping)
6. **Color Guide**: On/Off (complementary colored faces)

**🔧 Advanced Cut System:**

**Perpendicular Cuts:**
- Cut perpendicular to primary Y-axis slicing
- Rotate around X-axis with vertical drag
- Different colors to distinguish from primary pieces
- Creates complex interlocking puzzles

**Diagonal Cuts:**
- 45° angled cuts through the solid
- Rotate around Z-axis with horizontal drag
- Third color scheme for easy identification
- Adds maximum complexity

**🎯 Multi-Solid Support:**

**Tetrahedron**: Simplified rotation puzzle with positioned pieces
**Octahedron**: Y-axis sliced with scaled pieces
**Dodecahedron**: Complex 12-faced solid with Y-axis slicing
**Cube**: Full material array system with face-specific coloring

**🎮 Usage:**
1. Click the ⚙️ gear icon (top right)
2. Configure your test level
3. Click "Test Level" to try it
4. Use regular controls to switch back to campaign mode

**🎪 Advanced Features:**
- **Multi-axis rotation**: Different cut types rotate on different axes
- **Visual distinction**: Each cut type uses different colors
- **Smart snapping**: Works with all angles (15°/30°/45°)
- **Custom difficulty**: Override campaign progression
- **Wireframe rendering**: Works across all solid types

This sandbox lets you experiment with complex combinations - imagine a dodecahedron with 8 primary slices + 3 perpendicular cuts + 2 diagonal cuts on hard difficulty! It's the testing ground for finding the sweet spot of challenge vs. solvability.

# Corrected issues:

Let me check and fix the code issues. I can see there are problems with the material handling and snapping logic:Perfect! I've fixed all the critical issues:

**🔧 Fixed Bugs:**
- ✅ **setHex error**: Now properly handles both single materials and material arrays
- ✅ **15° snapping**: Fixed snap angle calculations and normalized rotation properly
- ✅ **Material references**: Removed unused `materials` property that was causing confusion
- ✅ **Better scrambling**: Animated scrambling with staggered timing for visual appeal

**🎯 Difficulty System Now Working:**

**Easy (45° = π/4):** 8 possible positions
- No colored side, just shape restoration
- Large snap increments, very forgiving

**Normal (30° = π/6):** 12 possible positions  
- Front face colored with complementary color
- Medium precision required
- Must align colored faces correctly

**Hard (15° = π/12):** 24 possible positions
- Colored side required for proper alignment
- Very precise rotations needed
- Maximum challenge

**🎮 Enhanced Features:**
- **Better scrambling**: Each slice rotates individually with timing delay
- **Robust material handling**: Works with both single and multi-face materials
- **Precise snapping**: All angles (15°, 30°, 45°) now work correctly
- **Visual feedback**: Proper highlighting and celebration effects

**🎨 Colored Side System:**
- Easy: Uniform color (shape-only puzzle)
- Normal/Hard: Front face uses complementary color as alignment guide
- Players must rotate slices so all colored faces align properly
